      <h1><u><b>Changes in employment</b></u></h1><br>
        <p>"Personally I think there is no need to worry too much about the 4th industrial revolution's changes. For example, my career of laws won't 
          be affected too much. Yes, the AI can better memorise the laws, etc. But it cannot read emotions or create empathy. Humans are the kinds of living being given with a 
          sense of logic <b>and</b> empathy. You need logic with the laws, to judge a person. But to declare him a culprit, depends on the jury. People need to be convinced, and 
          emotions could affect their judgement" said Ayikmert, an Oxford's student taking the degree of law.</p> <br>

      <p>Here we listened to the opinion of a Oxford student's opinion about 4th industrial revolution affecting his career. Yes, it's true that today's AI cannot read emotions, 
      and cannot do much about the careers linked to psychology... But would it be the case in the future ? And what about the other careers?</p><br><br>

        
        <p><h5><b><u>Datas</u></b></h5> 
         
          Every day, people share tons of content online through connected devices, generating massive amounts of data—GPS coordinates, environmental
           info, and more. This data is like fuel for artificial intelligence (AI), which powers innovations across various products and services. 
           The abundance of data enhances AI's ability to analyze transactions and variables using machine learning algorithms, making businesses 
           smarter. This helps anticipate consumer trends, personalize promotions, and optimize pricing.Here are a few examples of machine learning 
           innovations, organised by industry:<br>
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Retail: Highlight consumer sentiments toward a brand or predict which customers are mostly likely to purchase a particular product.
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Manufacturing: Optimise supply chain operations and predict the failure of machine parts.
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Travel: Plan vacations with the acumen of a human assistant.
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Medicine: Assist doctors in identifying different types of cancer cells and spotting intracranial abnormalities in real time.
          <br><br>
          Let's delve into each industry to explore how the technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution are influencing our rapidly advancing economy.
          <br><br><br>
          
          <h5><b><u>Transportation</u></b></h5> 
          Car-sharing services, cutting across industries like transportation, technology, insurance, and finance, offer a seamless customer 
          experience from request to payment, challenging the traditional concept of car ownership. For those who simply need a ride, disruptive 
          services like Uber and Lyft have transformed the transportation industry. With one of these services, 
          you can use your phone to:<br>
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Order a car to take you to a specific destination
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Track the vehicle as it heads your way
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Get information about the vehicle, driver, and price of the trip
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Pay for the ride and optionally, add a tip and feedback for the driver<br><br>
          Or if you want to own a car, why not own it instead as a service, so you don’t have access to just one car, but a whole fleet based on your needs? Need a coupe for the weekend? Change your car needs in the app, and Audi swaps it out for you. Car companies are looking hard at these models now.
          Advances in artificial intelligence, the Internet of things, clean energy, and other technologies can improve safety for drivers and pedestrians and potentially lead to greater use of public transportation and car-sharing services. This shift can result in reduced congestion and pollution, faster and cheaper commutes, and improved health.
          <br><br><br>
          
          <h5><b><u>Retail</u></b></h5> 
          In retail, personalization driven by AI is transforming sales, service, and marketing. Virtual customer service agents use AI for 
          transactions and smart recommendations. Machine learning routes service calls efficiently, and augmented reality lets shoppers see 
          product details in-store using devices like smart glasses. Virtual reality may soon enable trying on outfits at home. This shift could 
          impact postal services and supply chains. The future might involve 3D printing retail items locally. With advanced AI and prediction 
          technology, a shift from "shopping then shipping" to "shipping then shopping" is on the horizon, where goods are sent first, and returns 
          are made as needed.
<br><br><br>
          
          <h5><b><u>Finance</u></b></h5> 
          Financial institutions leverage artificial intelligence for various purposes, including fraud detection, equity research, and client 
          relationship management. AI aids financial advisors in predicting valuable prospects, determining optimal actions, and crafting 
          personalized customer journeys based on individual financial goals and life events.
          <br><br><br>
          
          <h5><b><u>Insurance</u></b></h5> 
          The insurance industry is exploring the use of wearable devices for health data and sensors for tracking driving habits. This data helps 
          determine insurance pricing, rewarding policyholders with better health or driving records with lower premiums. Car sensors can quickly 
          identify faults and notify both drivers and insurance companies about potential issues, streamlining the claims process.
          <br><br><br>
          
          <h5><b><u>Agriculture</u></b></h5> 
          AI-powered machine vision systems can measure crop populations and detect weeds or plant pests, and use robotic sprayers to 
          precisely apply herbicides. Bioengineered plants are leading to greater crop yields and new medicines, such as antimalarial 
          drugs produced from genetically modified tobacco plants.
          <br><br><br>
          
          <h5><b><u>Healthcare</u></b></h5> 
          Precision medicine helps doctors analyse a patient’s genome sequence, medical history, and lifestyle. That information, 
          coupled with demographic data from groups of people with similar conditions, as well as the latest research, helps doctors 
          create treatments and prevention therapies unique to an individual.
          <br><br><br>
          
          <h5><b><u>When Will the Future Arrive?</u></b></h5> 
          According to the World Economic Forum Technology Tipping Points and Societal Impact report, the following technology tipping points could occur by 2025:
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-10% of people wearing clothes connected to the Internet
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The first robotic pharmacist in the US
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The first 3D-printed car in production
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-5% of consumer products printed in 3D
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-90% of the population with regular access to the Internet
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Driverless cars equaling 10% of all cars on US roads
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The first transplant of a 3D-printed liver
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Over 50% of Internet traffic to homes for appliances and devices
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The first city with more than 50,000 people and no traffic lights
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-The first AI machine on a corporate board of directors
                      </p></p>

          <h1><u><b>Failure of businesses</b></u></h1><br><br>
          <p> As you can see, there is nothing that we can do in the future without computers and digitalisations. And there are many compagnies 
            and jobs which are failing, because they failed to read the trend of time. Even countries have failed, like Qing Dynasty which ignored 
            the improvements of the first industrial revolution.
          </p>
        <p>For a compagny, let's take example with Nokia. Why, this such a big enterprise, could have failed at one night?</p> 
          <img src="applevsnokia.png" class="a" width="700">
<br><br>
           
          <p> Well, first of all look at the image above, what would more likely attract your eyes? That's correct, the apple one ! Nokia's failure can be linked to several factors, including its inability to adapt to the changing landscape of the fourth 
          industrial revolution and the evolving preferences of consumers.<br><br> 

          -<u>Failure to Embrace Smartphones:</u> Nokia initially dominated the mobile phone market with its feature phones. However, 
          the company failed to anticipate the shift towards smartphones, which became a significant aspect of the fourth industrial 
          revolution. The emergence of touchscreens, app ecosystems, and advanced mobile operating systems caught Nokia off guard.<br><br>
          
          -<u>Lack of Innovation</u>: Nokia struggled to innovate rapidly in the smartphone era. The fourth industrial revolution emphasizes the 
          integration of technology into every aspect of daily life, and Nokia fell behind in terms of introducing cutting-edge features 
          and designs. Competitors like Apple and Samsung capitalized on this trend, offering smartphones with superior functionality and 
          aesthetics.<br><br>
          
          -<u>Ecosystem and App Store</u>: The fourth industrial revolution is characterized by interconnected digital systems and ecosystems. 
          Apple and Android, with their respective app stores, created powerful ecosystems that kept users within their platforms. 
          Nokia's Symbian operating system couldn't compete in terms of the variety and quality of apps, leading to a decline in user 
          interest.<br><br>
          
          -<u>Resistance to Change</u>: Nokia's corporate culture and leadership were resistant to change. The fourth industrial revolution 
          encourages adaptability and agility, but Nokia was slow to shift its focus and strategies. The company was known for its 
          hardware expertise but struggled to integrate software effectively, a critical aspect in the smartphone era.<br><br>
          
          -<u>Globalization and Market Dynamics</u>: The fourth industrial revolution brought about increased globalization and connectivity. 
          Nokia, a Finnish company, faced challenges in understanding and adapting to diverse global markets. Cultural nuances and 
          varying consumer preferences played a role in the company's struggles to maintain its market share.<br><br>
          
          -<u>Rapid Technological Advancements</u>: The fourth industrial revolution is characterized by the rapid advancement of technology. 
          Nokia's inability to keep pace with evolving hardware and software technologies contributed to its downfall. While competitors 
          introduced new and improved features, Nokia's offerings became outdated.<br><br>
          
          -<u>Shift in Consumer Preferences</u>: As the fourth industrial revolution progressed, consumer preferences shifted towards sleeker, 
          more user-friendly devices with intuitive interfaces. Nokia's traditional focus on durability and battery life became less 
          relevant as consumers prioritized features like touchscreens, app ecosystems, and multimedia capabilities.<br><br>

          In summary, Nokia's failure is intricately linked to its inability to adapt to the changes brought about by the fourth 
          industrial revolution. The company's resistance to innovation, slow response to evolving technologies, and failure to meet 
          shifting consumer preferences ultimately led to its decline in the mobile phone market. <br> 
          Here I am talking about only the third industrial revolution's change. Now think about the fourth industrial revolutions' AI.</p>
          <br><hr><br>

          <h1><b><u>New game changer : AI</u></b></h1><br>
            <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is making our lives more productive, but it can also disrupt jobs, similar to past revolutions. Jobs will 
            change as AI automates tasks, but like the Internet did years ago, it will create new jobs and transform existing ones, particularly 
            those requiring creativity and complex problem-solving.<br>
            
            However, people with less education and fewer skills might face challenges in the evolving job market. To cope with these changes, 
            businesses and governments should prioritize training for future jobs. Lifelong learning and career adaptation will be crucial for the 
            workforce of the future.
